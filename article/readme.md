### Carbon Emissions article

The EU has ramped up carbon emission regulations for maritime shipping. Ships need to purchase carbon credits for their voyage, a popular device in Environmental Economics. Since, carbon emisisons create costs outside the company, purchasing these credits makes the company pay for its external environmental damage. 

This will be a major change to the maritime shipping world. Shipping companies now must cover **100%** of their carbon emissions (by 2026).

However, current models only accurately predict 80% of carbon emissions. **BEARING.AI's AI model is more accurate**, taking the shift from "physics models" to **AI MODELS**


### Business case snippet

The financial implications are equally significant. For instance, a cargo vessel sailing within the EEA from 2025 and beyond that emits 15,000 tonnes of CO2 and faces a carbon price of €83 per tonne would have to bear an added cost of €1,245,000 annually. For a shipping company operating ten such vessels, this would amount to an additional expense of €12.5 million per year.
If these vessels could reduce their emissions by a mere 10%, the company could save €1,245,000 annually. However, if companies under predict their annual carbon spend, the unforeseen costs can be significant.
