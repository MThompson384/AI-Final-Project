## Company :office:

### Objective: 
This project focuses on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI), within Bearing, to assist companies with optimizing their Carbon Emissions. First, we will explore how advanced deep learning techniques are utilized to significantly reduce fuel consumption, enhance market opportunities, and improve overall fleet management for maritime shipping companies.

### Key Areas of Focus:

* Fuel Efficiency: Analyze and implement AI models that predict fuel consumption patterns and identify strategies for reduction.
* Market Analysis Optimization: Utilize AI to assess market conditions and help shipping companies make informed decisions regarding routing and cargo.
* Fleet Management Improvement: Enhance operational efficiency through predictive maintenance and real-time monitoring of fleet performance using AI technologies.
* Partnerships: Bearing has established collaborations with some of the largest shipping companies to field-test its AI technology on vessels globally, ensuring practical insights and adjustments based on real-world data.

### Expected Outcomes: 

:anchor: Development of robust AI-driven tools that lead to decreased operational costs and increased profit margins for shipping companies.

:anchor: Realization of an enhanced decision-making framework that leverages data analytics to seize market opportunities promptly.

:anchor: Through the exploration of these aspects, this project aims to contribute valuable insights into the effective use of AI in the maritime industry, helping Bearing reaffirm its position as an innovator   
in shipping technology.

## Project Details :computer:
### Project Description: 
This project examines the impact of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on the maritime shipping industry and highlights the role of Bearing AI in assisting companies with compliance and strategic decision-making. The EU ETS, a regulatory framework established by the European Union, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from various industries, including maritime shipping. As the EU ETS extends its scope to the maritime sector, shipping companies face operational and financial challenges, including the need to purchase carbon credits to offset emissions.

Bearing AI offers innovative technology solutions to help maritime vessel owners and operators navigate the complexities of the EU ETS. Their AI-powered Decision Engine enables users to accurately predict carbon emissions, forecast carbon credit costs, and optimize operational efficiency. By leveraging Bearing AI's predictive capabilities, shipping companies can make informed decisions that balance environmental responsibility, financial management, and operational efficiency.

This project will explore how Bearing AI's solutions can assist shipping companies in:

* Accurately predicting carbon emissions with up to 98% accuracy, compared to 80% with leading physics-based models.
* Forecasting carbon credit costs and allocation more precisely.
* Remaining competitive with lower operational costs.
* Maintaining environmental compliance under the EU ETS.
* By adopting Bearing AI's technology, shipping companies can reduce overall operation costs, improve profit margins, and gain a competitive edge in the market. This project aims to demonstrate the value of Bearing AI's contributions to the maritime industry's transition towards a more sustainable and environmentally responsible future.

### Key Features:

Following our analysis of the Bearing AI Research case, our team has developed a website demo featuring a Ship Emission Calculator designed to provide users with insights into their vessel's environmental impact. This tool leverages key operational factors to estimate emissions and offer actionable recommendations for reduction.

The Ship Emission Calculator incorporates the following features:

* **Emission Calculation:** The calculator estimates ship emissions based on user-provided inputs, including ship speed (knots), cargo weight (tons), and fuel type. This calculation provides a baseline understanding of the vessel's environmental footprint.
* **Emission Level Assessment:** The system assesses the calculated emissions and categorizes them as low, average, or high, providing users with a clear understanding of their vessel's performance relative to industry benchmarks.
* **Emission Reduction Recommendations:** If the system identifies high emissions, it offers emission reduction tips. These recommendations may include optimizing ship speed, adjusting cargo weight distribution, or exploring alternative fuel types.
* **Carbon Credit Estimation:** Based on the calculated emissions, the system provides an estimate of the number of carbon credits the user may need to purchase to comply with regulations such as the EU ETS. This estimation helps users understand the potential financial implications of their vessel's emissions.
  
This Ship Emission Calculator serves as a valuable tool for maritime stakeholders seeking to understand and mitigate their environmental impact. By providing accessible emission estimates and actionable recommendations, this tool empowers users to make informed decisions that promote sustainability and compliance with evolving environmental regulations.
